# sirstochastic

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of package sirstochastic is to run simulations of single and
multiple iterations of the SIR stochastic model.

## Installation

You can install the released version of sirstochastic from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("sirstochastic")
install.packages("png")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("reside-ic/sirstochastic")
```

## Equations

The equations defining the model are:

  - dS/dt = - beta \* S \* I / N
  - dI/dt = beta \* S \* I / N - sigma \* I
  - dR/dt = sigma \* I

and these are converted to the discrete stochastic model by imagining
that in a small period of time `dt` the chance of an event happening
follows a Bernoulli trial. In a discrete time step of size `dt` we model
the number of infections (i.e., the number of individuals who move from
`S` to `I`) as a binomial draw with `n = S` and `p = beta * I / N * dt`)
and the number of recoveries (movements from `I` to `R`) as a binomial
draw with `n = I` and `p = sigma * dt`. Note, N = S + I + R.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(sirstochastic)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)

#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00

#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
