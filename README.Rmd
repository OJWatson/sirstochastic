# sirstochastic

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of package sirstochastic is to run simulations of single and multiple iterations of the SIR stochastic model.

## Installation

You can install the released version of sirstochastic from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("sirstochastic")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("reside-ic/sirstochastic")
```

## Equations
The equations defining the model are:

* dS/dt = - beta * S * I / N
* dI/dt = beta * S * I / N - sigma * I
* dR/dt = sigma * I


and these are converted to the discrete stochastic model by imagining that in a small period of time `dt` the chance of an event happening follows a Bernoulli trial. In a discrete time step of size `dt` we model the number of infections (i.e., the number of individuals who move from `S` to `I`) as a binomial draw with `n = S` and `p = beta * I / N * dt`) and the number of recoveries (movements from `I` to `R`) as a binomial draw with `n = I` and `p = sigma * dt`. Note, N = S + I + R.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem. This is run for 10000 iterations, time step 0.01

```{r echo=FALSE, fig,cap = "SIR simulation, N= 10000, dt = 0.01"}
dt <- 0.01
sirstochastic::themodel(dt)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
